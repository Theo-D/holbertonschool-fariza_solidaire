# ZAFIRA SOLIDAIRE - Portfolio - Stage 2: Project Charter Development

## In this stage of the project we will develop a project charter that will serve as a foundation for all subsequent work

## 0 - Definition of the project objectives

### Project scope and relevance

This project aims to support **Zafira Solidaire**'s team in fulfilling their mission by improving the management of the association's core operations. It will also serve as a platform for stakeholders—such as potential users, investors and public authorities—to know and stay informed about the association’s actions and services.

The **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product) we are working on here should provide the following services among others to come:

| Feature Name           | Service provided |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Administrator Account  | An administrator account that will allow **Zafira Solidaire**'s team to access a control board that will allow them to manage the association's core operations (manage users, create blog posts, create and manage events...). |
| User account           | The possibility for an user to create an account that will grant them access to the services of the association. |
| Apointment management  | People wishing to donate professional clothing to the association should be able to do so by taking an apointment to deposit their donation. |

### Team members as internal stakeholders

Team members Ancelin Chevallier and Théo Dessaigne will work on both the front-end and back-end of the project. Tasks will be divided based on features to facilitate collaboration, distribute the workload into manageable units, and ensure that both developers have an active participation across all parts of the project.

## 2 - Scope definition

The main scope of the project consists in giving a platform to the association zafira-solidaire which aims to few simple features:

    - A counter of the given clothes mass
    - Another counter of helped people
    - A calendar, displaying the different workshops organized by the association
    - The calendar should permit to arrange meetings to give the clothes
    - A list of all financial and local partners
    - A "News" hub, displaying interviews of the local elected officials
    - A link to HelloAsso to donate money to the association

The part out of scope, for now at least, would be to add a messaging service for all users, the possbibility to attend to workshops or meetings with Fariza.

## 3 - Risks identification

The main difficulty of this project is the use of a new technology, Springboot, which is very technical and demanding.
The main risk would be to underestimate the time demanded to learn how to use it, wwhich would imply in  a lack of time to add all features to the project

The other one would be to have the most intuitive front-end possible, given that the client is not used to web technology, and the website has to be the clearest and easiest possible, otherwise it will not be used nor will achieve the expected visibility.
