## 1. Research and Brainstorming

### Research Phase

The main objective of our team was to learn more about technologies used in real-world companies. So we chose to look up for the most used languages and frameworks, keeping in mind that we still need them to conform to this projet's use cases. That's why we chose:
    -Java Springboot for developing the backend as it features an ORM (Hibernate), routes management and a diverse array of dependencies to customize our project as needed.
    -React.js for the front-end as the scope of the project suit well the use case this library was built for.

## 3. Decision and Refinement

### MVP Idea

Born from the realisation that people of different backgrounds are not equally equiped to face the hiring process, the association Fariza Solidaire was created to alleviate some of the hindrances these people might face.

To do so, the association provides professional clothing, image consulting, photo shoots and other kinds of services to ease the access to the employment market for those who require it, mostly young adults from 16 to 25.

To fulfill its duties it became clear that the association would need a website to showcase its achievements to potential users and investors, to allow members to make appointments and subscribe to workshops as well as providing support in organizing its activities.

### Key Features

- Event creation and management.
- Photo Gallery.
- Stat tracking.
- Online payment portal integration.
- Blog articles.
- Centralizing organization for clothing deposit.

### Expected Outcomes

- A working website that satisfies the expectations of the client according to what she is looking for.
